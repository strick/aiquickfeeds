            <p>The UK’s data protection watchdog, the ICO, has raised concerns about Snap’s AI chatbot ‘My AI,’ specifically regarding children’s privacy risks. The regulator stated that Snap’s risk assessment before launching the chatbot did not adequately assess the data protection risks posed by the generative AI technology, particularly to children. Snap will have the chance to respond before the ICO makes a final decision on whether the company has breached data protection rules.</p>
        
            <p>Snap launched the generative AI chatbot, powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, in February. The chatbot was initially available only to subscribers but later opened to free users. Despite moderation and safeguarding features in place, there have been reports of the chatbot providing inappropriate advice. Some users have also bullied the AI.</p>
        
            <p>European privacy regulators have previously scrutinized AI chatbots, including Italy’s Garante and Poland’s data protection authority investigating similar concerns.</p>

            <li>Researchers have developed a new approach to train AI models in mathematical problem solving called &#34;process supervision&#34; where the model is rewarded for each correct step of reasoning instead of just the final answer.</li>
        
            <li>The process supervision method improves performance compared to traditional outcome supervision methods and also aligns the model&#39;s chain of thought with human-approved processes, making it more interpretable.</li>
        
            <li>This approach can potentially reduce logical mistakes, known as hallucinations, in AI models and may have positive alignment effects in other domains as well.</li>

These features greatly expand the capabilities of ChatGPT, allowing it to browse the web and pull information from the internet, as well as connect to third-party applications through plugins.</li>
        
            <li>With internet access, ChatGPT is no longer limited to a closed knowledge base and can answer questions about recent events or specific topics. However, it is still important to be cautious with the results, as the AI may still generate erroneous or unreliable information.</li>
        
            <li>ChatGPT plugins function like browser extensions, adding third-party functionality to the AI agent. Users can add plugins for various purposes, such as finding restaurants, answering mathematical questions, or planning trips. Only three plugins can be enabled at once, and swapping plugins is necessary to access more functionalities.</li>
