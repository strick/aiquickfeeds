            <p>Swiss startup Lakera has launched with the aim of protecting enterprises from security weaknesses in large language models (LLMs), such as prompt injections and data leakage. The company has developed a database of insights from various sources, including its own research and data collected from an interactive game called Gandalf. Lakera&#39;s flagship product, Lakera Guard, compares customer inputs against these insights to detect and prevent prompt injections and other types of cyberattacks.</p>
        
            <p>Lakera is also focused on protecting companies from private or confidential data leaks, moderating content to ensure generative AI models don&#39;t serve up harmful or unsuitable content, and addressing inaccuracies or misinformation generated by LLMs. The company&#39;s launch comes at an opportune moment, as the EU AI Act is set to introduce regulations on LLM providers in the near future. Lakera&#39;s founders have served in advisory roles to the Act and aim to complement policy-making with developer-first perspectives.</p>

            <li>The original production of &#34;VALIS&#34; in 1987 was controversial, combining elements of classical and rock music and incorporating digital sound and intelligent interaction. The new production at MIT introduces AI-enhanced technologies developed by the Opera of the Future research group at the MIT Media Lab.</li>
        
            <li>The opera&#39;s story follows a character named Phil on a hallucinatory spiritual quest, blending the boundaries of reality and technology. The contemporary performance uses innovative set design and augmented reality theater techniques to create a disorienting and immersive experience for the audience.</li>

            <li>MIT engineers have developed a machine-learning system that can remotely evaluate patients&#39; motor function by analyzing videos of them in real-time. The system uses computer vision and machine-learning techniques to analyze videos and compute a clinical score based on patterns of poses detected in the video frames. The system was tested on videos of children with cerebral palsy and achieved over 70% accuracy in matching the clinical score determined by a clinician during an in-person visit.</li>
        
            <li>The method can be run on most mobile devices, allowing patients to be evaluated on their progress from the comfort of their own home. The video and clinical score can then be sent to a doctor for review. The researchers plan to adapt the method to evaluate other motor and neurological disorders, such as metachromatic leukodystrophy and stroke.</li>
        
            <li>This technology has the potential to reduce the stress and cost of frequent in-person evaluations, and could be used to remotely evaluate any condition that affects motor behavior. It may also help predict how patients would respond to interventions by allowing more frequent evaluations to assess their progress.</li>

This technique, called smoothing, summarizes many contact events into a smaller number of decisions, enabling the robot to quickly identify effective manipulation plans.</li>
        
            <li>This method could potentially allow factories to use smaller, mobile robots that can manipulate objects with their entire arms or bodies, reducing energy consumption and costs. It could also be useful for robots on exploration missions in space, as they can adapt quickly using only an onboard computer.</li>
        
            <li>The researchers combined their model with an algorithm that can efficiently search through all possible decisions the robot could make, reducing computation time to about a minute on a standard laptop. They tested their approach in simulations and with real robotic arms, achieving the same performance as reinforcement learning but in less time.</li>

            <li>Researchers at MIT and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have developed a computational model using machine learning that can analyze the sequence of about 400 genes to predict where a given tumor originated in the body.</li>
        
            <li>The model, named OncoNPC, was able to accurately classify at least 40% of tumors of unknown origin with high confidence in a dataset of 900 patients, increasing the number of patients eligible for targeted treatments.</li>
        
            <li>The researchers hope to expand the model to include other types of data, such as pathology and radiology images, to provide a more comprehensive prediction of tumor type, patient outcome, and optimal treatment.</li>

The technique involves two attack methods: an &#34;encoder&#34; attack that adjusts the image&#39;s latent representation to make it appear random, and a &#34;diffusion&#34; attack that optimizes perturbations to resemble a target image. Although PhotoGuard is not foolproof, it offers a preemptive measure to protect images from unauthorized manipulation by AI models.</p>

        <ul>
        
            <p>Researchers from MIT and Stanford University have developed a machine-learning technique that can efficiently learn to control a robot in dynamic environments with rapidly changing conditions. This technique uses structure from control theory to learn a model that can extract an effective controller directly from the model, reducing the need for separate controller learning. The researchers’ approach is able to learn an effective controller using fewer data and achieves better performance compared to other methods.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>The technique can be applied to various types of robots, such as drones and autonomous vehicles, and enables them to navigate challenging conditions, such as slippery roads or strong winds. The researchers’ approach incorporates structure in the dynamics of the system, which helps guide the control logic and leads to more effective, stabilizing controllers.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>The new machine-learning method is data-efficient, achieving high performance with fewer data points. It outperforms other approaches that require separate learning of dynamics and controller. The technique is inspired by how roboticists use physics to derive simpler models for robots and combines learning dynamics with control-oriented structure from data to create more efficient controllers.</p>

These features greatly expand the capabilities of ChatGPT, allowing it to browse the web and pull information from the internet, as well as connect to third-party applications through plugins.</li>
        
            <li>With internet access, ChatGPT is no longer limited to a closed knowledge base and can answer questions about recent events or specific topics. However, it is still important to be cautious with the results, as the AI may still generate erroneous or unreliable information.</li>
        
            <li>ChatGPT plugins function like browser extensions, adding third-party functionality to the AI agent. Users can add plugins for various purposes, such as finding restaurants, answering mathematical questions, or planning trips. Only three plugins can be enabled at once, and swapping plugins is necessary to access more functionalities.</li>

            <li>Data filtering was done using image classifiers to remove graphic violence and sexual content. However, this filtering also introduced or amplified biases, with models trained on filtered data producing more images depicting men and fewer images depicting women compared to models trained on the original dataset.</li>
        
            <li>To address bias amplification, OpenAI used a reweighting strategy to balance the distribution of the filtered dataset to match the unfiltered dataset. This helped mitigate the bias introduced by data filtering and improved the behavior of the model.</li>
